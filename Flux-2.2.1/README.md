Flux Chess 2.2.1 UCI
====================

Introduction
------------
Flux Chess is an attempt to write a computer chess engine entirely in 
Java. The speed of most Java Virtual Machines is improving nowadays. 
However compared to other C/C++ chess engines Flux is still slow (or 
maybe my algorithms are not that sophisticated?). 

As a pure UCI chess engine, Flux does not have a graphical user 
interface. You can load him however into your favorite chess program if 
it supports the UCI protocol. I suggest you take a look at the free 
chess program Arena. I'm personally testing Flux with the Shredder 
Classic chess program. 

If you find any bugs or just want to write a comment, don't hesitate to 
contact me. 


Features
--------
Below you will find a small list of what I have already implemented in 
Flux. Nothing special though as many computer chess engines have those 
features as well. 

In addition Flux supports multi pv output, which means Flux can show 
multiple best pv lines. 

### Board
- 0x88 Board Representation

### Search
- Alpha-Beta Search
- Quiescent Search
- Iterative Deepening
- Internal Iterative Deepening
- Principal Variation Search
- Aspiration Windows

### Tables
- Transposition Table with Zobrist Keys
- Killer Moves
- History Heuristic

### Prunings
- Mate Distance Pruning
- Verified Null-Move Pruning
- Futility Pruning, Extended Futility Pruning
- Late Move Reduction

### Extensions
- Single-Reply Extension
- Check Extension
- Pawn Extension
- Recapture Extension
- Mate Threat Extension


System Requirements
-------------------
Because Flux is written in Java, you will have to install the Java 
Runtime Environment on your machine. Currently he only supports UCI for 
communicating with the GUI. If you want to use the XBoard interface, 
have a look at PolyGlot. 


Installation
------------
Just untar the tar file anywhere you like and add the Flux.bat (Windows) 
or Flux (Linux) as a new engine in your GUI. Make sure you select UCI as 
the protocol type. If you want to use the XBoard protocol there's a 
minimal PolyGlot INI file called polyglot.ini- Windows or 
polyglot.ini-Linux. Here's how to use the engine on linux with xboard: 

	xboard -fd <directory of unzipped Flux> -fcp 'polyglot polyglot.ini-Linux'


Configuration
-------------
Flux has its own configuration file and supports the UCI 
option/setoption commands. The configuration file is a plain ASCII file 
and should be placed in the same directory as Flux. Please note that the 
file should be called "Flux.ini". 

As it is also possible to set the same options in your chess GUI, Flux 
reads the options as follows: 

1. If a UCI setoption command is recognized, the option will be set 
	according to this value. 

2. If there's no setoption command, Flux tries to read the Flux.ini 
	file. 

3. If the option is not set in the Flux.ini file a compiled-in default 
	value is used. 

Flux recognizes the following options:

- Hash (4MB - 256MB, Default: 16MB)  
	The Hash Table size in megabytes

- Evaluation Table (4MB - 64MB, Default: 4MB)  
	The Evaluation Table size in megabytes

- Pawn Table (4MB - 16MB, Default: 4MB)  
	The Pawn Table size in megabytes


Build him
---------
Flux uses [Gradle](http://gradle.org) as build system. To build him from 
source, use the following steps. 

### Get him
`git clone https://github.com/fluxroot/fluxchess.git`

### Build him
`./gradlew build`

### Grab him
`cp build/distributions/Flux-2.2.1.tgz <very important engine directory>`
